The answer is 10 because there are ten perfect squares
between 1 and 100 (the squares of 1 through 10) and
because a door is left open if and only if its index
is a perfect square.

Why a door will be left open at the end of the 100-Doors
probelm if and only if the index of the door is a perfect
square:

During round N, we start by visiting N and all multiples of
N up to 100.  Hence, in round N, we visit all doors whose
indices are divisible by N.

The dual: now instead of thinking about each 'round' of the
process described in the 100-Doors problem statement
and which doors must be visited in a given round, think
from the perspective of each of the 100 doors and reason
about which rounds will visit the given door.

So from the perspective of a given door M, we ask how many
numbers in [1, M] divide M -- that will be the number of
times door M is visited in the 100-Doors problem.

All doors start closed.  When a door is visited it is opened if
it was previously closed and closed if previously open.  So we
see that at the end of the 100-Doors problem, a door is open
if and only if that door is visited an odd number of times.

So how do we determine whether a door at index M will be
visited an odd number of times?  We don't need to count
the numbers in [1, M] that divide M.  Instead, note that if a
number Q in [1, M] divides M, then (M/Q) also divides M.
So if door M is visited in round Q, it will also be visited
in round (M/Q); that's two visits for each number that
divides M -- except in the case of Q = (M/Q).  If Q = (M/Q),
we will have one visit to M that is not offset by another visit.
And and integer Q = (M/Q) divides M if and only if M is a
perfect square.
